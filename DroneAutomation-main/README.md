# Autonomous Farm Drone Software Project
Drone Automation (Drone Farming) Github & GitLab Link to repository: https://github.com/JoshPatton26/DroneAutomation & https://gitlab.com/jzubia25/DroneAutomation

Welcome to the repository for the <b>Software Development</b> course project at The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). This repository documents the collaborative work completed during the course, focusing on creating an application to implement autonomous flight features for the Tello drone. The project utilized Java programming, JavaFX for the user interface, and the Tello SDK to achieve autonomous farm tasks. The project was managed using the Agile Scrum methodology, with a focus on teamwork, software development life cycles, and practical application of OOP principles.

<h3> Introduction </h3>
This repository compiles the work undertaken during the <b>Software Development</b> course at UAB, where the primary focus was on collaborative project development. The project aimed to design and implement an application that could control a Tello drone autonomously to perform various farm-related tasks.

<h2> Project Overview </h2>
<h3> Objective </h3>
The primary objective of the project was to create an application that could interface with a Tello drone using the Tello SDK and Java programming. The application aimed to enable the drone to perform autonomous flight tasks on a farm setting, such as locating livestock, identifying water sources, monitoring crops, fertilizing crops, scanning geological features, scanning the farm area, and a point-and-fetch feature.

<h3> Features </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>User Interface (JavaFX):</b> The application features a user-friendly interface built using JavaFX to interact with users and configure autonomous flight tasks. </li>
  <li> <b>Drone Communication (Tello SDK):</b> The Tello drone's SDK was utilized to establish communication between the application and the drone, enabling control of its autonomous flight features. </li>
  <li> <b>Agile Scrum Methodology:</b> The project was managed using the Agile Scrum methodology, which involved dividing the project into sprints and focusing on incremental development, continuous feedback, and adapting to changing requirements. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Technologies Used </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Java </li>
  <li> JavaFX </li>
  <li> Tello SDK </li>
</ul>

<h3> Agile Scrum Methodology </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Sprints:</b> The project was divided into multiple sprints, each focusing on specific tasks and features. This iterative approach allowed for continuous development and adaptation. </li>
  <li> <b>Scrum Meetings:</b> Regular meetings were held to discuss progress, plan upcoming sprints, and address any obstacles. This improved communication and transparency within the team. </li>
  <li> <b>Product Backlog:</b> The project's features and tasks were organized in a backlog. The team prioritized items and selected those to be addressed in each sprint. </li>
  <li> <b>User Stories:</b> Requirements were expressed as user stories, helping the team understand the user's perspective and ensuring the project met the end users' needs. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Team Roles </h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Lead:</b> Joshua Patton <ul><li>Responsible for managing the project, organizing team activities, and overseeing progress.</li></ul></li>
  <li><b>Developers:</b> John Thompkins, Jesus Zubia, Eli Davis, Eric Dollar, Kodie Box, Joe Tiller <ul><li>Collaborated on coding, implementing features, and ensuring the project's technical aspects were on track.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3> Running the Project </h3>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Drone Setup:</b> <ul><li> Turn on the DJI Tello Drone. </li><li> Connect your computer to the drone's WiFi network. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>IDE Setup:</b> <ul><li> Open your preferred IDE (Eclipse or VSCode). </li><li> Ensure that you have JavaFX properly set up in your IDE. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>Project Import:</b> <ul><li> Clone or download the repository to your local machine. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>Project Open:</b> <ul><li> Open the project in your IDE. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>Code Execution:</b> <ul><li> Locate the main Java file that contains the entry point of the application (e.g., <b>'Main.java'</b>). </li><li> Run the application using the IDE's built-in execution feature. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>User Interface:</b> <ul><li> Once the application is running, you will see the user interface (UI) of the autonomous farm drone software. </li><li> Make sure your drone is powered on and connected to its WiFi network. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>UI Interaction:</b> <ul><li> Use the UI controls to initiate various autonomous flight tasks, such as locating livestock, identifying water sources, monitoring crops, fertilizing crops, scanning geological features, scanning the farm area, and the point-and-fetch feature. </li><li> Be cautious and ensure you are in an appropriate environment for drone flight. </li></ul></li>
  <li> <b>TreeView Selection:</b> <ul><li> Note that when clicking buttons, you need to have a TreeItem selected from the TreeView in the top-left corner of the UI. </li><li> Not selecting an item may result in a NullPointerException, although the application will continue to function. </li></ul></li>
</ol>

<h3> Precautions and Notes </h3>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Flight Environment:</b> Avoid flying the drone in dimly lit rooms or areas with potential interference from other WiFi or Bluetooth devices, as this could lead to errors or unintended behavior. </li>
  <li> <b>IDE Compatibility:</b> The project was tested and developed primarily using Eclipse and VSCode. While it may work in other IDEs, it is recommended to test thoroughly if using a different IDE. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Usage </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Run the Java application to launch the user interface. </li>
  <li> Connect the application to a Tello drone using the Tello SDK's communication protocols. </li>
  <li> Use the interface to initiate and control autonomous flight tasks, such as livestock detection, crop monitoring, and more. </li>
</ul>
